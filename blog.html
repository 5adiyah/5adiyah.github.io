          <p>"This is where it all begins! A hands-on introduction to all of the essential tools you'll need to build real, working websites. You'll learn what web developers actually do â€“ the foundations you'll need for later courses." - The Odin Project</p>

          <p>My New Years resolution this year to code more. In 2016 I attended and graduated from Epicodus a programming bootcamp. Since then I have returned to school to finish up a Bachelor's Degree so I have not been coding as much and I feel as though I'm starting to forget everything. For the next few months I'll be going through the Odin Project curriculum to review and sharpen my programming skills. This is a very simple blog for me to keep track of what I'm learning, my projects, and also my struggles.</p>

          <p>I'm also doing this because I realized how my github turned into a ghost town and I want to keep it active. The Odin project is project based so hopefully I will also have more projects to add to my portfolio.</p>
